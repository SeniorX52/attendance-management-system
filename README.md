## Installation Instructions

### Import the Database Schema

1. Locate the `database_schema_dump.sql` file in the installation folder.
2. Use a MySQL client or command-line tool to import this file into your MySQL server. This will create the necessary database structure for AMS.

### Configure Database Connection

1. Click on the settings icon in the application.
2. Enter the database connection details: hostname, database name, and port (usually 3306 for MySQL).
3. The application will automatically store your database connection details (username, password, and database name) on your device. These details are securely stored and **not** shared over the internet.

### Run the Application

1. After setting up the database and configuring the connection, run AMS as an administrator. The application requires administrative privileges to access the database successfully.
